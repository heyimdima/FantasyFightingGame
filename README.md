# Fantasy Fighting Game

---
## Overview
This was the project I did for my CST-210 class, and this was the first time I had to make a project on this scale,
and after getting it done I can still see some things that could be improved about it.

## Objective
Create a Fantasy Fighting Text-Based Game and:
* Utilize functions to decomposed complex tasks. 
* Utilize polymorphic variables. 
* Consist of two main elements: a store to buy equipment (better weapons, better armor) and an arena in which to fight for money. 
* Provide the ability to save player progress. 
* Provide the ability to load player progress.
* Provide the ability for the player to view their character sheet at will.
---

---
## Purpose
* Selecting and designing objects found in a real world. 
* Using inheritance and composition to build classes. 
* Coordinating logical interactions between objects to model.

## My Approach

### UML Diagram / Object-Oriented Solution
I started by creating the following UML Diagram

All the classes eventually connect in the class `Game`, which connects `Character`, `Arena`, and the `Shop` classes.
