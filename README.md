# Fantasy Fighting Game

## Overview
This was the project I did for my CST-210 class, and this was the first time I had to make a project on this scale,
and after getting it done I can still see some things that could be improved about it.

## Objective
* Create a Fantasy Fighting Text-Based Game that and:
*1 Utilize functions to decomposed complex tasks. 
*2 Utilize polymorphic variables. 
*3 Consist of two main elements: a store to buy equipment (better weapons, better armor, more max health) and an arena in which to fight for money. 
*4 Provide the ability to save your player progress (use file I/O for this). 
*5 Provide the ability to load your player through command line prompt. 
*6 Provide the ability for the player to view their character sheet at will.


## Purpose
* Selecting and designing objects found in a real world. 
* Using inheritance and composition to build classes. 
* Coordinating logical interactions between objects to model.
